        Replaces a region of the source image with a substitute image and returns the resulting image.

        This method analyzes the source image to find an appropriate area to replaceâ€”either based on
        a dominant color (via k-means clustering) or a default background color (white). It then resizes
        the substitute image to fit the identified region and pastes it into the source image.

        Args:
            source_img_path (str): Path to the original image to modify.
            substitute_img_path (str): Path to the image to paste into the source.
            use_dominant_color (bool, optional): If True, attempts to find the replacement area
                based on the most dominant color in the source image. Defaults to False.
            dominant_cluster_amount (int, optional): Number of clusters to use when identifying
                the dominant color (used only if `use_dominant_color` is True). Defaults to 3.
            resize_to (tuple, optional): If provided, explicitly resizes the substitute image to this
                size (width, height) before pasting. If None, it resizes based on the detected area.

            PIL.Image.Image: The modified source image with the substitute image pasted in.

        Validates whether the most recent substitution was within acceptable size bounds.

        This method compares the area of the substitute image (after being pasted into the source image)
        to the total area of the source image. If the substitute image covers too little or too much of
        the source (as defined by `threshold_min` and `threshold_max`), the substitution is considered invalid.

        Args:
            threshold_min (float, optional): The minimum acceptable ratio of substitute area to total image area.
                Defaults to 0.1 (10%). Values below this are considered too small to be valid.
